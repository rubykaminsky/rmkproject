        This is a situation comedy webcomic about neighbors in an apartment
        building. Below we have our characters who live in the building! From left to right, Gemma, Penny, Louie, George, and Max. 
      <p>
        Gemma has been living in the building her whole life, she loves EDM, vaccuums regularly, and is keen to get to know *some* of her new neighbors. If you engage her in the elevator, she will start complaining about puppy that has moved in upstairs. 
     <p>
        Penny moved in to the building just weeks ago. Many people mistake her for the DJ type, but really she just has a sticky fingers problem... 
     <p>
        Louie is the building's French resident. He comes from the Bourgogne region. His mother often sends him cheese. This cheese's stench somehow, but very often, infiltrates the entire building.  
     <p> 
       George and Max have just gotten a puppy. They were early on the gentrifying scene, and now like to talk about how much the neighborhood has changed since they moved in. Gemma scoffs.
