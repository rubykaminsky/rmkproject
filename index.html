        This is a situation comedy webcomic about neighbors in an apartment
        building. Below we have our characters who live in the building! From left to right, Gemma, Penny, Louie, George, and Max. 
      <p>
        Gemma has been living in the building her whole life, she loves EDM, vaccuums weekly, and is keen to get to know *some* of her new neighbors. If you engage her in the elevator, she will start complaining about puppy that has moved in upstairs. 
     <p>
        Penny moved in to the building just weeks ago. She might have a sticky fingers problem... and is dsperately in love with her upstairs neighbor. 
     <p>
        Louie is the building's French resident. He comes from the Bourgogne region. His mother often sends him cheese. This cheese's stench somehow, but very often, infiltrates the entire building.  
     <p> 
       George and Max have just gotten a puppy. They were early on the gentrifying scene, and now like to talk about how much the neighborhood has changed. George is blissfully unaware that Penny has feelings for her, but enjoys their brief chats in the laundry room.
